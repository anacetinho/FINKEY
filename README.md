## 🚀 What Makes FinKey Special

FinKey builds upon the solid foundation of Maybe Finance with enhanced features:

- **🤖 Flexible AI Assistant** - Configure AI directly in the UI! Choose between OpenAI or run your own local LLM (Ollama, LM Studio, etc.) without editing environment files
- **🌍 Yahoo Finance Integration** - Real-time exchange rates for accurate multi-currency tracking
- **💸 Advanced Expense Reimbursement System** - Handle complex transaction scenarios with ease
- **⚡ Enhanced Docker Setup** - Improved deployment and development experience
- **📊 Advanced Forecasting** - 24-month projections using a 12-month rolling average for stable, seasonal-aware trend analysis
- **📅 Yearly Budgeting** - View aggregated yearly totals and monthly averages alongside standard monthly views

## 🚀 Quick Start - One-Click Setup!

FinKey is designed to be self-hosted, giving you complete control over your financial data.

### Windows Users
```batch
git clone https://github.com/your-username/finkey.git
cd finkey
setup.bat
```

### Linux/macOS Users
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/finkey.git
cd finkey
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

**That's it!** The setup script handles everything automatically:
- ✅ Checks Docker installation
- ✅ Creates configuration files
- ✅ Downloads and builds all services
- ✅ Starts your FinKey instance
- ✅ Opens http://localhost:3000 in your browser

> **⏳ Note**: On first startup, it may take 2-3 minutes for the application to become available at `localhost:3000` due to Docker container initialization. If you experience delays, you can also access the app using your local IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.xxx:3000`) which typically loads faster.

### Manual Setup (Advanced Users)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/finkey.git
cd finkey
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings
docker-compose up -d
```
